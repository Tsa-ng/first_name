<h1 align="center">My First Day At A Tech School</h1>
<body>
    <p> A whirlwind of emotions filled me as I woke up on June 4th. Excitement bubbled for the tech adventure that dawned before me, while nervousness fluttered in my stomach.  Having long dreamt of forging a path in the digital world, discovering SQI, a tech school renowned for its flexible learning approach, further stoked the flames of my passion.  This felt like the perfect launchpad to propel me into the exciting and ever-evolving world of tech.</p>
    <p> I got there at 8:10 am and approached the receptionist with a wave of relief washing over me. Explaining my tardiness on opening day and inquiring about my assigned class, I was met with a disarming smile and genuine friendliness.  She then led me to my classroom, where I settled into a seat, the room buzzing with a diverse group of individuals, each with their own unique tech journey about to begin.  </p>
    <p> At exactly 10:00 am sharp, the instructor walked into the classroom and confidently set up his laptop. He looked around the room and noticed a few new faces, including me! With a friendly smile, he welcomed everyone and explained that he would be reviewing the material from the previous day to make sure everyone was on the same page. </p>
    <p>My First day in tech school was not just about learning new skills but it was about embarking on a transformative journey of self discovery and exploration.</p>
